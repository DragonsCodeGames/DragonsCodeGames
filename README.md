Welcome to DragonsCode! 

We are two young indie developers who are working on Thrones Of War, a multiplayer medieval war game. ToW
is a strategy game, where you can direct your attack of nobles and knights to defeat your opponent's defenses. 

We appreciate any feedback you have. Remember to email us if you would like an update 
on Thrones Of War. A public discord server will be available as soon as ToW comes out.
